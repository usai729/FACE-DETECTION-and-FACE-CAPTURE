# FACE-DETECTION-and-FACE-CAPTURE

Used <b>OpenCV</b> and <b>Python</b> for this project.<br>
The dataset I used <i>Does not belong to me</i>

I first detect the faces and determine the size of the box on the face, the dimensions are taken and used to capture, crop and save the image of only the face
